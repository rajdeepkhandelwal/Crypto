		Investors should keep in mind that <i>Crypto</i> is just a tool that helps make their job easier. You should never base your investment activity upon one information source, and it’s important that you take the time to research your investments thoroughly before proceeding. Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, and it’s very easy to make a bad move when investing in unproven financial instruments such as initial coin offerings. Investors should make sure to diversify their holdings and invest carefully to protect themselves from disaster.
